<h1>Public Gateway Network</h1>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>A set of nodes</p>
<p>XCHG network is in testing mode.</p>
<p>Now only 2 nodes are available:</p>
<li>54.37.73.160 - 500 Megabit/sec</li>
<li>54.37.73.229 - 500 Megabit/sec</li>

<h2>What services are offered by the nodes of this network?</h2>
<p>Your service is registered on any node of the network. Address of your service is an RSA public key.</p>
<p>Clients find the host your service is connected to. They send messages to your service.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<h3>Address protection</h3>
<p>Address is your RSA public key. Only your service can confirm that this is its own address.</p>
<h3>Data encryption</h3>
<p>All traffic between your service and xchg-node is encrypted by AES-256. Key exchange - RSA-2048.</p>
<p>Traffic between Client and Service encrypted by AES-256. Key exchange - RSA-2048.</p>

<h2>Cost</h2>
<p>All the nodes are free for use. Limited frame size and request frequency.</p>
<p>You can support the project by donations.</p>

<h2>Add your xchg-node</h2>
<p>You can support the network if you have server with unlimited traffic. Just install xchg and it will be connected to cloud automatically.</p>
