<h1>XCHG White Papper</h1>

<h2>Issue</h2>
<div>
    Decentralized applications need a way to communicate. It would be great if all nodes had a static IP address. But in fact it is impossible.
    In any case, the server is needed for the interaction of peers. One of the options for convenient interaction of peers with each other is the XCHG protocol.
</div>

<h2>Problem Decomposition</h2>
<div>Let's say we have two dapps behind NAT. What tasks need to be solved so that these programs communicate with each other.</div>
<div>Each decentralized application must have a unique address throughout the world.</div>
<div>Programs should have a meeting point where they can at least find each other.</div>
<div>The application must have a way to prove that it is it.</div>
<div>It is necessary that traffic between applications be encrypted.</div>

<h2>Problem solution</h2>
<div>First of all, applications need to meet somewhere. This meeting place must have a public IP-address.</div>
<div>Therefore, there must be a server somewhere on the Internet that will accept connections from peers and redirect data between them. Let's call it a router. It is a lightweight server that can be run on low power hardware.</div>
<div>The router should just be a delivery service with minimal overhead. This will allow for multiple such servers to provide fault tolerance.</div>
<div>The router must distinguish peers by their addresses. </div>
<div>The easiest way to ensure address uniqueness is a SHA256 of the RSA public key.</div>
<div>So, we have peers connected to the router. Each peer has an address that it can prove ownership of.</div>
<div>It remains only to add AES point-to-point encryption and the soup is ready.</div>

<h2>How problems are solved in XCHG protocol</h2>
<div>The router is a lightweight repeater. It only uses RSA-encryption to verify peer addresses.</div>
<div>Encrypting data between peers is their concern.</div>
<div>The peer SDK has everything you need for peer authentication, peer-to-peer AES-256 encryption, and link failover.</div>
<div>The peer itself chooses through which router to receive requests to itself or through which peer to send requests to other peers.</div>
<div>All a router needs is to provide forwarder services.</div>
<div>In addition, the router should be the first barrier against DOS-attacks.</div>
